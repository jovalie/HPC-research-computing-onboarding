Hosted at the University of Southern California (USC) and managed by the Center for Advanced Research Computing (CARC), Laguna is a state-of-the-art system boasting 2 shared login nodes, 20 compute nodes, and 8 GPU nodes. Through an extensively collaborative effort, the SoCal Regional Research Computing Alliance hopes that access to this advanced computing environment and comprehensive user services will propel local campus research forward exponentially.

## National Supercomputers: ACCESS

<img src="{{ '/images/hpc-intro/nsf-access.png' | relative_url }}" alt="NSF Access Collection" class="img-67-centered" />

ACCESS is a collection of integrated advanced digital resources and services that provide easy access to the most advanced computational resources and scientific research support in the world. QCL has two Campus Champions who are trained to help local users utilize national supercomputing resources available through the NSF Access program. From various national supercomputing facilities, QCL has awarded a large number of computing hours for testing and developing scientific applications (see below).

The Service Unit (SU) is like a currency used to run an application on supercomputers. Supercomputer users are charged by SUs (hours of runtime on one core). For example, if an application ran on 100 cores for 10 hours, 1,000 SUs will be deducted from your account.

The Campus Champion allocations can be used to test computational research applications. To test out the supercomputers, please make an appointment with one of the CMC Campus Champions (email: qcl@cmc.edu).
